# iRacing Season Planner in finally here!
### And it works!

# How does it work?
### First things first. 
Simply download the latest installer [**[Releases]**](https://github.com/KindaMe/iracing-season-planner/releases) and do the thing people do with installers.

### Now inside the iRSP.
You select all the cars and tracks you currently own.
